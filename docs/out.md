Then let us say that for an individual to be \emph{among the agents of an event} is for there to be actions $A_1$, ...\ $A_n$ which  ground this event, where the individual is an agent of some (one or more) of these actions.

A \emph{goal} of some actions is an outcome to which they are directed.

Note that, confusingly, the term ‘goal’ is sometimes used for what I am calling goal-states.
Whatever terminology is used, it is essential to distinguish goals from goal-states.
From the fact that an action is directed to a particular goal it does not follow that the agent of the action has a goal-state representing this goal \citep{Bratman:1984jr}.
It doesn't even follow that the agent has any goal-states at all if, as some have argued, it is possible to understand what it is for at least some actions to be directed to goals without appeal to goal-states \citep[e.g.][]{Bennett:1976rg,Taylor:1964tr}.

A \emph{goal-state} is a state of an agent which specifies an outcome and which is, or could be, related to the agent’s actions in such a way that these actions are directed to the outcome represented.

  ‘A \emph{joint action} is an event with two or more agents’ %, as  contrasted with an \emph{individual action} which is an event with a  single agent’

Taking a minimalist approach means finding a simplest possible starting point, adding ingredients only as needed, and adding only ingredients widely used outside of philosophical and narrowly theoretical debates.

Pietroski identified a simple and elegant way of generalising from the idea that an individual can be the agent of an action to the idea that an individual can be the agent of a larger event.
(His account does require a minor correction, but this is not relevant here.)
His approach can be generalised to allow for any number of agents.
% §± grounding #df
Let us stipulate that events $D_1$, ...\ $D_n$ \emph{ground} $E$, if: $D_1$, ...\ $D_n$ and $E$ occur;
$D_1$, ...\ $D_n$ are each (perhaps improper) parts of $E$; and
every event that is a proper part of $E$ but does not overlap $D_1$, ...\ $D_n$ is caused by some or all of $D_1$, ...\ $D_n$.

To illustrate, consider the hunters again.
Let \textsc{the episode} be an event comprising only the hunter’s actions, the deer’s death and the events causally linking these.
Since, for each hunter, there is a set of events including the hunter’s shooting which ground \textsc{the episode}, we can conclude that \textsc{the episode} is a joint action on Ludwig’s proposed definition.
