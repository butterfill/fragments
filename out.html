<p>Then let us say that for an individual to be  is for there to be actions <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub>1</sub></span>, ... <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> which ground this event, where the individual is an agent of some (one or more) of these actions. %</p>

<p>Note that, confusingly, the term ‘goal’ is sometimes used for what I am calling goal-states. Whatever terminology is used, it is essential to distinguish goals from goal-states. From the fact that an action is directed to a particular goal it does not follow that the agent of the action has a goal-state representing this goal . It doesn't even follow that the agent has any goal-states at all if, as some have argued, it is possible to understand what it is for at least some actions to be directed to goals without appeal to goal-states .][]{Bennett:1976rg,Taylor:1964tr}. %</p>

<p>A  is a state of an agent which specifies an outcome and which is, or could be, related to the agent’s actions in such a way that these actions are directed to the outcome represented. %</p>

<p>Taking a minimalist approach means finding a simplest possible starting point, adding ingredients only as needed, and adding only ingredients widely used outside of philosophical and narrowly theoretical debates. %</p>

<p>Pietroski identified a simple and elegant way of generalising from the idea that an individual can be the agent of an action to the idea that an individual can be the agent of a larger event. (His account does require a minor correction, but this is not relevant here.) His approach can be generalised to allow for any number of agents. % §± grounding Let us stipulate that events <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span>, ... <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>  <span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span>, if: <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span>, ... <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> occur; <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span>, ... <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> are each (perhaps improper) parts of <span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span>; and every event that is a proper part of <span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> but does not overlap <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span>, ... <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> is caused by some or all of <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub></span>, ... <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>. %</p>

<p>To illustrate, consider the hunters again. Let  be an event comprising only the hunter’s actions, the deer’s death and the events causally linking these. Since, for each hunter, there is a set of events including the hunter’s shooting which ground , we can conclude that  is a joint action on Ludwig’s proposed definition. %</p>
