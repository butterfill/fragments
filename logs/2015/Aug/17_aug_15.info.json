Challenge is to capture the distinction.\n\n\n% The existence of joint actions—things such as carrying a heavy picnic basket together or playing a piano duet—is sometimes taken to warrant the creation of complex structures, often involving conceptual or ontological novelties and invariably occasioning terminological innovation.\n% But we can understand much about joint action without any of this, or so I aim to show in this chapter.\n% %, which introduces a minimally novel conceptual framework.\n% %My aim is to demonstrate how much can be achieved with the \n\nThere are phenomena, call them \\emph{joint actions}, paradigm cases of which are held to involve two people \n\tpainting a house together \\citep{Bratman:1992mi}, \n\tlifting a heavy sofa together \\citep{Velleman:1997oo}, \n\tpreparing a hollandaise sauce together \\citep{Searle:1990em}, \n\tgoing to Chicago together \\citep{Kutz:2000si}, \n\tand walking together \\citep{gilbert_walking_1990}.\nIn developmental psychology paradigm cases of joint action include  two people \n\ttidying up the toys together \\citep{Behne:2005qh},\n\tcooperatively pulling handles in sequence to make a dog-puppet sing \\citep{Brownell:2006gu},\n\tbouncing a block on a large trampoline together \\citep{Tomasello:2007gl},\n\tand pretending to row a boat together.\nOther paradigm cases from research in cognitive psychology include two people\n\tlifting a two-handled basket  \\citep{Knoblich:2008hy},\n\tputting a stick through a ring \\citep{ramenzoni_joint_2011},\n\tand swinging their legs in phase \\citep[p. 284]{schmidt_richardons:_2008}.\nWhat feature or features distinguish joint actions such as these from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n\n\n% the question matters\nThis is a useful question to pursue because\njoint action raises {a tangle of scientific and philosophical questions}.\n%\nPsychologically and neuroscientifically we want to know which mechanisms make it possible \\citep{Sebanz:2006yq,vesper_minimal_2010,sacheli:2015_causative}.\nDevelopmentally we want to know when joint action emerges, what it presupposes and whether it might somehow facilitate socio-cognitive, pragmatic or symbolic development \\citep{Moll:2007gu,Hughes:2004zj,Brownell:2006gu}.\nPhenomenologically we want to characterise what (if anything) is special about experiences of action and agency when collective agency is involved \\citep{Pacherie:2010fk}.\nMetaphysically we want to know what kinds of entities and structures are implied by the existence of joint action \\citep{helm_plural_2008,Searle:1994lb}.\nAnd normatively we want to know what kinds of commitments (if any) are entailed by joint action and how these commitments arise \\citep{Roth:2004ki,gilbert:2014_book}.\n%, plus a formal account of how practical reasoning for joint action differs (if at all) from individual practical reasoning \\citep{Sugden:2000mw,Gold:2007zd}\n%\nIn investigating these questions it is useful to have a conceptual framework which enables us to distinguish systematically between joint and individual action.\nThis is why we should ask, What distinguishes joint actions from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n \n\nCould coordination be this distinguishing feature?\nCompare two sisters cycling to school together with two strangers who, some way behind the sisters, happen to be cycling the same route side-by-side.\nBoth pairs of cyclists need to coordinate their actions in order to avoid colliding, but only the former is a joint action.\nSo the bare fact that actions are coordinated, even very tightly coordinated in ways that require expertise, cannot be what distinguishes joint action from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\n\nAnother  initially tempting idea is that common effects distinguish joint actions.\nWhen members of a flash mob in Café Central respond to a pre-arranged cue by noisily opening their newspapers, they perform a joint action with a common effect.\nBut when someone not part of the mob just happens to noisily open her newspaper in response to the same cue, her action is not part of any joint action.\nYet her action together with those of the members of a flash mob have a common effect.\nSo what distinguishes joint actions from events involving multiple agents who merely act in parallel can’t be just that joint actions have common effects.\n \n \nAt this point it is natural to appeal to intention.\nIf we are performing actions of some type $\\phi$,\nthen perhaps for our doing this to be a joint action is just for us to be doing this\nbecause we each intend that we, you and I, $\\phi$ together.\n% Intentional joint action occurs when there is an act-type, φ, such that each of several agents intends that they, these agents, φ.\n(Does the appeal to togetherness make this circular? Not as long as we understand ‘together’ only in the sense in which the three legs of a tripod can support a flask {together}.\nCan one person have intentions which concern not only her own actions but also others’?\nYes, see \\citet{Bratman:1993je}.)\nAppealing to intention seems to take us further than the first two ideas (coordination and common effects).\nConsider the cycling sisters again.\nWe could suppose that each sister intends that they, the two sisters cycle to school together; but nothing like this is plausibly true of the strangers who just happen to be cycling side-by-side.\n\nHave we already understood what distinguishes joint action?\nImagine two sisters who, getting off an aeroplane, tacitly agree to exact revenge on the unruly mob of drunken hens behind them by standing so as to block the aisle together.\nThis is a joint action.\nMeanwhile on another plane, two strangers happen to be so configured that they are collectively blocking the aisle.\nThe first passenger correctly anticipates that the other passenger, who is a complete stranger, will not be moving from her current position for some time.\nThis creates an opportunity for the first passenger: she intends that they, she and the stranger, block the aisle.\nAnd, as it happens, the second passenger’s thoughts mirror the first’s.\nSo the feature under consideration as distinctive of joint action is present: each passenger is acting on her intention that they, the two passengers, block the aisle.\nBut the contrast between this case and the sisters exacting revenge suggests that these passengers are not taking part in a joint action—at least, their’s is not the kind of joint action associated with the paradigm cases mentioned at the start of this chapter.\nApparently, then, %it is possible for two or more agents to each intend that they do one thing together and to act on these intentions without them thereby performing a joint action.\nour being involved in a joint action can’t be a matter only of there being something such that we each intend that we, you and I, do it together.\n What are we missing?\n\n% Consider the flash mob and the bystander again.\n% Suppose the flash mob picks out an arbitrary bystander with a newspaper and takes that bystander’s cracking open the newspaper to be the signal to act.\n% Plausibly, then, the members of the flash mob might each intend that they, the members of the flash mob and this bystander, crack open their newspapers together.\n% Now suppose that, just by chance, the bystander figures out what is going on.\n% As someone who enjoys this kind of thing, she might crack open her newspaper with the intention that she and the members of the flash mob crack open their newspapers together.\n% So the feature under consideration as distinctive of joint action is present:\n% there is an action type such that the bystander and the members of the flash mob each intend that they, these people, perform such an action together.\n% But for all this it seems the bystander is not taking part in a joint action.\n% Apparently, then, %it is possible for two or more agents to each intend that they do one thing together and to act on these intentions without them thereby performing a joint action.\n% our being involved in a joint action can’t be a matter only of there being something such that we each intend that we, you and I, do it together.\n%  What are we missing?\n\n% \\emph{*Example not very compelling: replace it with two people blocking the aisle (each unilaterally intends that they block the aisle, correctly predicting that the other will not move while remaining agnostic about why).}\n\n\nIt’s just here that, in philosophy at least, things get a little wild.\nAttempts to provide the missing ingredient in characterising joint action include introducing novel kinds of intentions \\citep{Searle:1990em} or modes \\citep{gallotti:2013_social}, novel kinds of agents \\citep{helm_plural_2008}, and novel kinds of reasoning \\citep{Gold:2007zd}.\nOthers suggest embedding intentions in special kinds of commitment \\citep{gilbert:2014_book}, or creating special nested structures of intention and common knowledge \\citep{bratman:2014_book}.\nPerhaps some or all of these innovations are in some way useful.\nBut are they really needed just to understand how joint actions differ from event involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n\nThe dominant assumption is that they are.\nTo illustrate, consider Gilbert’s position.\nAccording to her, all joint action involves shared intention, and our having a shared intention that we $\\phi$ involves our being jointly committed to emulate a single body with an intention that it  $\\phi$.\nIn order to create the joint commitment necessary for us to have a shared intention, we must each openly express readiness to participate in this commitment.\nFurther, it must be common knowledge among us that we each express such readiness.\nHer account thus implies that, in order for us to share a smile or carry a two-handled picnic basket together, each of us must know that the other is ready to form a joint commitment to emulate a single body with an intention to carry the basket \\citep[][p.~334]{gilbert:2014_book}.\nFew would agree with Gilbert that exactly this nesting of mental states and commitments is necessary for joint action (this is no reflection on Gilbert—few philosophers would agree with anyone’s view on what is necessary for joint action).\nBut many do follow Gilbert in thinking that distinguishing the kind of joint action involved in the examples given at the start of this chapter requires either comparably complex nested structures or novel ingredients.\n\nBy contrast Bratman has recently observed, in effect, that introducing such complex structures or novel ingredients is not obviously needed just to distinguish joint action from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel \\citep[p.~105]{bratman:2014_book}.\nFor all anyone has yet shown, there may be a way of capturing what is distinctive of the kind of joint actions mentioned at the start of this chapter without invoking novel ingredients or structures.\nThis chapter explores the possibility that there is, with the twofold aim of constructing a minimalist theoretical framework for understanding at least simple forms joint action and illuminating the nature of the intentions and commitments involved in the most sophisticated forms of joint action.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{A Minimalist Approach: First Step}\n \n% §± minimalist_approach\nTaking a minimalist approach means finding a simplest possible starting point, adding ingredients only as needed, and adding only ingredients widely used outside of philosophical and narrowly theoretical debates.\n% ±§\nWhat determines whether an additional ingredient is needed?\nThe aim is to distinguish joint actions like those mentioned at the start of the chapter from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\n\n% The minimalist approach combines two things that are already familiar but have yet to be combined.\n% Its focus is on the simplest, rather than the most sophisticated, cases of joint action, and it follows Bratman (and one strand of Gilbert’s thinking, too) in aiming to avoid conceptual innovation.\n\nAs a promising starting point, consider a claim from Ludwig's semantic analysis:\n%\n\\begin{quote}\n% §± ludwig_joint_action p.366 #quote key.ludwig_collective_2007\n  ‘A \\emph{joint action} is an event with two or more agents’ %, as  contrasted with an \\emph{individual action} which is an event with a  single agent’\n% ±§\n \\citep[p.\\ ~366]{ludwig_collective_2007}.\n\\end{quote}\n%\nTo illustrate, suppose two hunters each hit a deer with an arrow.\nNeither shot was individually fatal but together they were deadly.\nIn this case the hunters are agents of the killing of the deer, so the event counts as  a joint action on Ludwig’s proposal.\n\nTo fully understand Ludwig’s proposal we need to understand what it is for an individual to be among the agents of an arbitrary event and not just an action.\nThis can be done in terms of a notion of grounding which I adapt from a discussion of action by \\citet{pietroski_actions_1998}.\n% §± pietroski_grounding\nPietroski identified a simple and elegant way of generalising from the idea that an individual can be the agent of an action to the idea that an individual can be the agent of a larger event.\n(His account does require a minor correction, but this is not relevant here.)\nHis approach can be generalised to allow for any number of agents.\n% §± grounding #df\nLet us stipulate that events $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ \\emph{ground} $E$, if: $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ and $E$ occur;\n$D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ are each (perhaps improper) parts of $E$; and\nevery event that is a proper part of $E$ but does not overlap $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ is caused by some or all of $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$.\n% ±§\n% §± agent_of_event #df\nThen let us say that for an individual to be \\emph{among the agents of an event} is for there to be actions $A_1$, ...\\ $A_n$ which  ground this event, where the individual is an agent of some (one or more) of these actions.\n% ±§\n% ±§\n% §± pietroski_grounding_illustration\nTo illustrate, consider the hunters again.\nLet \\textsc{the episode} be an event comprising only the hunter’s actions, the deer’s death and the events causally linking these.\nSince, for each hunter, there is a set of events including the hunter’s shooting which ground \\textsc{the episode}, we can conclude that \\textsc{the episode} is a joint action on Ludwig’s proposed definition.\n% ±§\n\nThis definition is too broad.\nTo see why, first recall our premise that one requirement on any account of joint action is this: \nit should distinguish joint actions like those mentioned at the start of this chapter from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\nNow consider two ways of elaborating the story about the hunters.\nIn one they are best friends who have set out together with the

Challenge is to capture the distinction.\n\n\n% The existence of joint actions—things such as carrying a heavy picnic basket together or playing a piano duet—is sometimes taken to warrant the creation of complex structures, often involving conceptual or ontological novelties and invariably occasioning terminological innovation.\n% But we can understand much about joint action without any of this, or so I aim to show in this chapter.\n% %, which introduces a minimally novel conceptual framework.\n% %My aim is to demonstrate how much can be achieved with the \n\nThere are phenomena, call them \\emph{joint actions}, paradigm cases of which are held to involve two people \n\tpainting a house together \\citep{Bratman:1992mi}, \n\tlifting a heavy sofa together \\citep{Velleman:1997oo}, \n\tpreparing a hollandaise sauce together \\citep{Searle:1990em}, \n\tgoing to Chicago together \\citep{Kutz:2000si}, \n\tand walking together \\citep{gilbert_walking_1990}.\nIn developmental psychology paradigm cases of joint action include  two people \n\ttidying up the toys together \\citep{Behne:2005qh},\n\tcooperatively pulling handles in sequence to make a dog-puppet sing \\citep{Brownell:2006gu},\n\tbouncing a block on a large trampoline together \\citep{Tomasello:2007gl},\n\tand pretending to row a boat together.\nOther paradigm cases from research in cognitive psychology include two people\n\tlifting a two-handled basket  \\citep{Knoblich:2008hy},\n\tputting a stick through a ring \\citep{ramenzoni_joint_2011},\n\tand swinging their legs in phase \\citep[p. 284]{schmidt_richardons:_2008}.\nWhat feature or features distinguish joint actions such as these from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n\n\n% the question matters\nThis is a useful question to pursue because\njoint action raises {a tangle of scientific and philosophical questions}.\n%\nPsychologically and neuroscientifically we want to know which mechanisms make it possible \\citep{Sebanz:2006yq,vesper_minimal_2010,sacheli:2015_causative}.\nDevelopmentally we want to know when joint action emerges, what it presupposes and whether it might somehow facilitate socio-cognitive, pragmatic or symbolic development \\citep{Moll:2007gu,Hughes:2004zj,Brownell:2006gu}.\nPhenomenologically we want to characterise what (if anything) is special about experiences of action and agency when collective agency is involved \\citep{Pacherie:2010fk}.\nMetaphysically we want to know what kinds of entities and structures are implied by the existence of joint action \\citep{helm_plural_2008,Searle:1994lb}.\nAnd normatively we want to know what kinds of commitments (if any) are entailed by joint action and how these commitments arise \\citep{Roth:2004ki,gilbert:2014_book}.\n%, plus a formal account of how practical reasoning for joint action differs (if at all) from individual practical reasoning \\citep{Sugden:2000mw,Gold:2007zd}\n%\nIn investigating these questions it is useful to have a conceptual framework which enables us to distinguish systematically between joint and individual action.\nThis is why we should ask, What distinguishes joint actions from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n \n\nCould coordination be this distinguishing feature?\nCompare two sisters cycling to school together with two strangers who, some way behind the sisters, happen to be cycling the same route side-by-side.\nBoth pairs of cyclists need to coordinate their actions in order to avoid colliding, but only the former is a joint action.\nSo the bare fact that actions are coordinated, even very tightly coordinated in ways that require expertise, cannot be what distinguishes joint action from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\n\nAnother  initially tempting idea is that common effects distinguish joint actions.\nWhen members of a flash mob in Café Central respond to a pre-arranged cue by noisily opening their newspapers, they perform a joint action with a common effect.\nBut when someone not part of the mob just happens to noisily open her newspaper in response to the same cue, her action is not part of any joint action.\nYet her action together with those of the members of a flash mob have a common effect.\nSo what distinguishes joint actions from events involving multiple agents who merely act in parallel can’t be just that joint actions have common effects.\n \n \nAt this point it is natural to appeal to intention.\nIf we are performing actions of some type $\\phi$,\nthen perhaps for our doing this to be a joint action is just for us to be doing this\nbecause we each intend that we, you and I, $\\phi$ together.\n% Intentional joint action occurs when there is an act-type, φ, such that each of several agents intends that they, these agents, φ.\n(Does the appeal to togetherness make this circular? Not as long as we understand ‘together’ only in the sense in which the three legs of a tripod can support a flask {together}.\nCan one person have intentions which concern not only her own actions but also others’?\nYes, see \\citet{Bratman:1993je}.)\nAppealing to intention seems to take us further than the first two ideas (coordination and common effects).\nConsider the cycling sisters again.\nWe could suppose that each sister intends that they, the two sisters cycle to school together; but nothing like this is plausibly true of the strangers who just happen to be cycling side-by-side.\n\nHave we already understood what distinguishes joint action?\nImagine two sisters who, getting off an aeroplane, tacitly agree to exact revenge on the unruly mob of drunken hens behind them by standing so as to block the aisle together.\nThis is a joint action.\nMeanwhile on another plane, two strangers happen to be so configured that they are collectively blocking the aisle.\nThe first passenger correctly anticipates that the other passenger, who is a complete stranger, will not be moving from her current position for some time.\nThis creates an opportunity for the first passenger: she intends that they, she and the stranger, block the aisle.\nAnd, as it happens, the second passenger’s thoughts mirror the first’s.\nSo the feature under consideration as distinctive of joint action is present: each passenger is acting on her intention that they, the two passengers, block the aisle.\nBut the contrast between this case and the sisters exacting revenge suggests that these passengers are not taking part in a joint action—at least, their’s is not the kind of joint action associated with the paradigm cases mentioned at the start of this chapter.\nApparently, then, %it is possible for two or more agents to each intend that they do one thing together and to act on these intentions without them thereby performing a joint action.\nour being involved in a joint action can’t be a matter only of there being something such that we each intend that we, you and I, do it together.\n What are we missing?\n\n% Consider the flash mob and the bystander again.\n% Suppose the flash mob picks out an arbitrary bystander with a newspaper and takes that bystander’s cracking open the newspaper to be the signal to act.\n% Plausibly, then, the members of the flash mob might each intend that they, the members of the flash mob and this bystander, crack open their newspapers together.\n% Now suppose that, just by chance, the bystander figures out what is going on.\n% As someone who enjoys this kind of thing, she might crack open her newspaper with the intention that she and the members of the flash mob crack open their newspapers together.\n% So the feature under consideration as distinctive of joint action is present:\n% there is an action type such that the bystander and the members of the flash mob each intend that they, these people, perform such an action together.\n% But for all this it seems the bystander is not taking part in a joint action.\n% Apparently, then, %it is possible for two or more agents to each intend that they do one thing together and to act on these intentions without them thereby performing a joint action.\n% our being involved in a joint action can’t be a matter only of there being something such that we each intend that we, you and I, do it together.\n%  What are we missing?\n\n% \\emph{*Example not very compelling: replace it with two people blocking the aisle (each unilaterally intends that they block the aisle, correctly predicting that the other will not move while remaining agnostic about why).}\n\n\nIt’s just here that, in philosophy at least, things get a little wild.\nAttempts to provide the missing ingredient in characterising joint action include introducing novel kinds of intentions \\citep{Searle:1990em} or modes \\citep{gallotti:2013_social}, novel kinds of agents \\citep{helm_plural_2008}, and novel kinds of reasoning \\citep{Gold:2007zd}.\nOthers suggest embedding intentions in special kinds of commitment \\citep{gilbert:2014_book}, or creating special nested structures of intention and common knowledge \\citep{bratman:2014_book}.\nPerhaps some or all of these innovations are in some way useful.\nBut are they really needed just to understand how joint actions differ from event involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n\nThe dominant assumption is that they are.\nTo illustrate, consider Gilbert’s position.\nAccording to her, all joint action involves shared intention, and our having a shared intention that we $\\phi$ involves our being jointly committed to emulate a single body with an intention that it  $\\phi$.\nIn order to create the joint commitment necessary for us to have a shared intention, we must each openly express readiness to participate in this commitment.\nFurther, it must be common knowledge among us that we each express such readiness.\nHer account thus implies that, in order for us to share a smile or carry a two-handled picnic basket together, each of us must know that the other is ready to form a joint commitment to emulate a single body with an intention to carry the basket \\citep[][p.~334]{gilbert:2014_book}.\nFew would agree with Gilbert that exactly this nesting of mental states and commitments is necessary for joint action (this is no reflection on Gilbert—few philosophers would agree with anyone’s view on what is necessary for joint action).\nBut many do follow Gilbert in thinking that distinguishing the kind of joint action involved in the examples given at the start of this chapter requires either comparably complex nested structures or novel ingredients.\n\nBy contrast Bratman has recently observed, in effect, that introducing such complex structures or novel ingredients is not obviously needed just to distinguish joint action from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel \\citep[p.~105]{bratman:2014_book}.\nFor all anyone has yet shown, there may be a way of capturing what is distinctive of the kind of joint actions mentioned at the start of this chapter without invoking novel ingredients or structures.\nThis chapter explores the possibility that there is, with the twofold aim of constructing a minimalist theoretical framework for understanding at least simple forms joint action and illuminating the nature of the intentions and commitments involved in the most sophisticated forms of joint action.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{A Minimalist Approach: First Step}\n \n% §± minimalist_approach\nTaking a minimalist approach means finding a simplest possible starting point, adding ingredients only as needed, and adding only ingredients widely used outside of philosophical and narrowly theoretical debates.\n% ±§\nWhat determines whether an additional ingredient is needed?\nThe aim is to distinguish joint actions like those mentioned at the start of the chapter from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\n\n% The minimalist approach combines two things that are already familiar but have yet to be combined.\n% Its focus is on the simplest, rather than the most sophisticated, cases of joint action, and it follows Bratman (and one strand of Gilbert’s thinking, too) in aiming to avoid conceptual innovation.\n\nAs a promising starting point, consider a claim from Ludwig's semantic analysis:\n%\n\\begin{quote}\n% §± ludwig_joint_action p.366 #quote key.ludwig_collective_2007\n  ‘A \\emph{joint action} is an event with two or more agents’ %, as  contrasted with an \\emph{individual action} which is an event with a  single agent’\n% ±§\n \\citep[p.\\ ~366]{ludwig_collective_2007}.\n\\end{quote}\n%\nTo illustrate, suppose two hunters each hit a deer with an arrow.\nNeither shot was individually fatal but together they were deadly.\nIn this case the hunters are agents of the killing of the deer, so the event counts as  a joint action on Ludwig’s proposal.\n\nTo fully understand Ludwig’s proposal we need to understand what it is for an individual to be among the agents of an arbitrary event and not just an action.\nThis can be done in terms of a notion of grounding which I adapt from a discussion of action by \\citet{pietroski_actions_1998}.\n% §± pietroski_grounding\nPietroski identified a simple and elegant way of generalising from the idea that an individual can be the agent of an action to the idea that an individual can be the agent of a larger event.\n(His account does require a minor correction, but this is not relevant here.)\nHis approach can be generalised to allow for any number of agents.\n% §± grounding #df\nLet us stipulate that events $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ \\emph{ground} $E$, if: $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ and $E$ occur;\n$D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ are each (perhaps improper) parts of $E$; and\nevery event that is a proper part of $E$ but does not overlap $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ is caused by some or all of $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$.\n% ±§\n% §± agent_of_event #df\nThen let us say that for an individual to be \\emph{among the agents of an event} is for there to be actions $A_1$, ...\\ $A_n$ which  ground this event, where the individual is an agent of some (one or more) of these actions.\n% ±§\n% ±§\n% §± pietroski_grounding_illustration\nTo illustrate, consider the hunters again.\nLet \\textsc{the episode} be an event comprising only the hunter’s actions, the deer’s death and the events causally linking these.\nSince, for each hunter, there is a set of events including the hunter’s shooting which ground \\textsc{the episode}, we can conclude that \\textsc{the episode} is a joint action on Ludwig’s proposed definition.\n% ±§\n\nThis definition is too broad.\nTo see why, first recall our premise that one requirement on any account of joint action is this: \nit should distinguish joint actions like those mentioned at the start of this chapter from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\nNow consider two ways of elaborating the story about the hunters.\nIn one they are best friends who have set out together with the aim of killing this deer, and they are exhibiting many features associated with paradigm cases of joint action.\nIn the other elaboration, the hunters are bitter rivals completely unaware of each other’s presence.\nIn fact, were either to have suspected the other was present, she would have abandoned the deer in order to target her rival.\nIn both elaborations, Ludwig’s proposal entails that \\textsc{the episode} is a joint action.\nBut whereas the best friends elaboration resembles paradigm cases of joint action, the bitter rivals are merely acting in parallel.\nBy itself, Ludwig’s attractively simple proposal is insufficient.%\n\\footnote{%\nShould we have considered the idea that a joint action is an \\emph{action} (rather than an event) with two or more agents?\nThis question

illustrate, suppose two hunters each hit a deer with an arrow.\nNeither shot was individually fatal but together they were deadly.\nIn this case the hunters are agents of the killing of the deer, so the event counts as  a joint action on Ludwig’s proposal.\n\nTo fully understand Ludwig’s proposal we need to understand what it is for an individual to be among the agents of an arbitrary event and not just an action.\nThis can be done in terms of a notion of grounding which I adapt from a discussion of action by \\citet{pietroski_actions_1998}.\n% §± pietroski_grounding\nPietroski identified a simple and elegant way of generalising from the idea that an individual can be the agent of an action to the idea that an individual can be the agent of a larger event.\n(His account does require a minor correction, but this is not relevant here.)\nHis approach can be generalised to allow for any number of agents.\n% §± grounding #df\nLet us stipulate that events $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ \\emph{ground} $E$, if: $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ and $E$ occur;\n$D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ are each (perhaps improper) parts of $E$; and\nevery event that is a proper part of $E$ but does not overlap $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ is caused by some or all of $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$.\n% ±§\n% §± agent_of_event #df\nThen let us say that for an individual to be \\emph{among the agents of an event} is for there to be actions $A_1$, ...\\ $A_n$ which  ground this event, where the individual is an agent of some (one or more) of these actions.\n% ±§\n% ±§\n% §± pietroski_grounding_illustration\nTo illustrate, consider the hunters again.\nLet \\textsc{the episode} be an event comprising only the hunter’s actions, the deer’s death and the events causally linking these.\nSince, for each hunter, there is a set of events including the hunter’s shooting which ground \\textsc{the episode}, we can conclude that \\textsc{the episode} is a joint action on Ludwig’s proposed definition.\n% ±§\n\nThis definition is too broad.\nTo see why, first recall our premise that one requirement on any account of joint action is this: \nit should distinguish joint actions like those mentioned at the start of this chapter from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\nNow consider two ways of elaborating the story about the hunters.\nIn one they are best friends who have set out together with the aim of killing this deer, and they are exhibiting many features associated with paradigm cases of joint action.\nIn the other elaboration, the hunters are bitter rivals completely unaware of each other’s presence.\nIn fact, were either to have suspected the other was present, she would have abandoned the deer in order to target her rival.\nIn both elaborations, Ludwig’s proposal entails that \\textsc{the episode} is a joint action.\nBut whereas the best friends elaboration resembles paradigm cases of joint action, the bitter rivals are merely acting in parallel.\nBy itself, Ludwig’s attractively simple proposal is insufficient.%\n\\footnote{%\nShould we have considered the idea that a joint action is an \\emph{action} (rather than an event) with two or more agents?\nThis question raises several issues beyond the scope of the present chapter.\nThe short answer is no, because primitive actions (whether bodily movements or tryings) are ‘all the actions there are’ \\citep[p.~59]{Davidson:1971fz}, and in many paradigm cases of joint action there are clearly no primitive actions with multiple agents.\nIn painting a house, walking together or lifting a two-handled basket we each move only our own bodies directly. \nThe notion of a joint action as an action with two or more agents is therefore too narrow relative to our aim of theorising about a range of cases taken to be paradigmatic joint actions.\n(This is not to say that no actions have two or more agents; see \\citealp{blomberg:2011_socially}.)\n}\n\nWhat is missing from this first attempt to capture joint action?\nMany joint actions are goal-directed in the sense that, among all their actual outcomes, there is an outcome to which they are directed.\nPerhaps we can make progress by integrating goal-directedness into our theoretical framework.\n\n\\section{Goal Directed Joint Action}\n\\label{sec:goal-directed-joint}\n\n\n% §± goal #df\nA \\emph{goal} of some actions is an outcome to which they are directed.\n% ±§\n% §± goal_state #df\nA \\emph{goal-state} is a state of an agent which specifies an outcome and which is, or could be, related to the agent’s actions in such a way that these actions are directed to the outcome represented.\n% ±§\nIntentions are perhaps the most familiar kind of goal-state.\n% §± goal_goal-state\nNote that, confusingly, the term ‘goal’ is sometimes used for what I am calling goal-states.\nWhatever terminology is used, it is essential to distinguish goals from goal-states.\nFrom the fact that an action is directed to a particular goal it does not follow that the agent of the action has a goal-state representing this goal \\citep{Bratman:1984jr}.\nIt doesn't even follow that the agent has any goal-states at all if, as some have argued, it is possible to understand what it is for at least some actions to be directed to goals without appeal to goal-states \\citep[e.g.][]{Bennett:1976rg,Taylor:1964tr}. \n% ±§\n\nAlmost all %not swinging

Challenge is to capture the distinction.\n\n\n% The existence of joint actions—things such as carrying a heavy picnic basket together or playing a piano duet—is sometimes taken to warrant the creation of complex structures, often involving conceptual or ontological novelties and invariably occasioning terminological innovation.\n% But we can understand much about joint action without any of this, or so I aim to show in this chapter.\n% %, which introduces a minimally novel conceptual framework.\n% %My aim is to demonstrate how much can be achieved with the \n\nThere are phenomena, call them \\emph{joint actions}, paradigm cases of which are held to involve two people \n\tpainting a house together \\citep{Bratman:1992mi}, \n\tlifting a heavy sofa together \\citep{Velleman:1997oo}, \n\tpreparing a hollandaise sauce together \\citep{Searle:1990em}, \n\tgoing to Chicago together \\citep{Kutz:2000si}, \n\tand walking together \\citep{gilbert_walking_1990}.\nIn developmental psychology paradigm cases of joint action include  two people \n\ttidying up the toys together \\citep{Behne:2005qh},\n\tcooperatively pulling handles in sequence to make a dog-puppet sing \\citep{Brownell:2006gu},\n\tbouncing a block on a large trampoline together \\citep{Tomasello:2007gl},\n\tand pretending to row a boat together.\nOther paradigm cases from research in cognitive psychology include two people\n\tlifting a two-handled basket  \\citep{Knoblich:2008hy},\n\tputting a stick through a ring \\citep{ramenzoni_joint_2011},\n\tand swinging their legs in phase \\citep[p. 284]{schmidt_richardons:_2008}.\nWhat feature or features distinguish joint actions such as these from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n\n\n% the question matters\nThis is a useful question to pursue because\njoint action raises {a tangle of scientific and philosophical questions}.\n%\nPsychologically and neuroscientifically we want to know which mechanisms make it possible \\citep{Sebanz:2006yq,vesper_minimal_2010,sacheli:2015_causative}.\nDevelopmentally we want to know when joint action emerges, what it presupposes and whether it might somehow facilitate socio-cognitive, pragmatic or symbolic development \\citep{Moll:2007gu,Hughes:2004zj,Brownell:2006gu}.\nPhenomenologically we want to characterise what (if anything) is special about experiences of action and agency when collective agency is involved \\citep{Pacherie:2010fk}.\nMetaphysically we want to know what kinds of entities and structures are implied by the existence of joint action \\citep{helm_plural_2008,Searle:1994lb}.\nAnd normatively we want to know what kinds of commitments (if any) are entailed by joint action and how these commitments arise \\citep{Roth:2004ki,gilbert:2014_book}.\n%, plus a formal account of how practical reasoning for joint action differs (if at all) from individual practical reasoning \\citep{Sugden:2000mw,Gold:2007zd}\n%\nIn investigating these questions it is useful to have a conceptual framework which enables us to distinguish systematically between joint and individual action.\nThis is why we should ask, What distinguishes joint actions from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n \n\nCould coordination be this distinguishing feature?\nCompare two sisters cycling to school together with two strangers who, some way behind the sisters, happen to be cycling the same route side-by-side.\nBoth pairs of cyclists need to coordinate their actions in order to avoid colliding, but only the former is a joint action.\nSo the bare fact that actions are coordinated, even very tightly coordinated in ways that require expertise, cannot be what distinguishes joint action from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\n\nAnother  initially tempting idea is that common effects distinguish joint actions.\nWhen members of a flash mob in Café Central respond to a pre-arranged cue by noisily opening their newspapers, they perform a joint action with a common effect.\nBut when someone not part of the mob just happens to noisily open her newspaper in response to the same cue, her action is not part of any joint action.\nYet her action together with those of the members of a flash mob have a common effect.\nSo what distinguishes joint actions from events involving multiple agents who merely act in parallel can’t be just that joint actions have common effects.\n \n \nAt this point it is natural to appeal to intention.\nIf we are performing actions of some type $\\phi$,\nthen perhaps for our doing this to be a joint action is just for us to be doing this\nbecause we each intend that we, you and I, $\\phi$ together.\n% Intentional joint action occurs when there is an act-type, φ, such that each of several agents intends that they, these agents, φ.\n(Does the appeal to togetherness make this circular? Not as long as we understand ‘together’ only in the sense in which the three legs of a tripod can support a flask {together}.\nCan one person have intentions which concern not only her own actions but also others’?\nYes, see \\citet{Bratman:1993je}.)\nAppealing to intention seems to take us further than the first two ideas (coordination and common effects).\nConsider the cycling sisters again.\nWe could suppose that each sister intends that they, the two sisters cycle to school together; but nothing like this is plausibly true of the strangers who just happen to be cycling side-by-side.\n\nHave we already understood what distinguishes joint action?\nImagine two sisters who, getting off an aeroplane, tacitly agree to exact revenge on the unruly mob of drunken hens behind them by standing so as to block the aisle together.\nThis is a joint action.\nMeanwhile on another plane, two strangers happen to be so configured that they are collectively blocking the aisle.\nThe first passenger correctly anticipates that the other passenger, who is a complete stranger, will not be moving from her current position for some time.\nThis creates an opportunity for the first passenger: she intends that they, she and the stranger, block the aisle.\nAnd, as it happens, the second passenger’s thoughts mirror the first’s.\nSo the feature under consideration as distinctive of joint action is present: each passenger is acting on her intention that they, the two passengers, block the aisle.\nBut the contrast between this case and the sisters exacting revenge suggests that these passengers are not taking part in a joint action—at least, their’s is not the kind of joint action associated with the paradigm cases mentioned at the start of this chapter.\nApparently, then, %it is possible for two or more agents to each intend that they do one thing together and to act on these intentions without them thereby performing a joint action.\nour being involved in a joint action can’t be a matter only of there being something such that we each intend that we, you and I, do it together.\n What are we missing?\n\n% Consider the flash mob and the bystander again.\n% Suppose the flash mob picks out an arbitrary bystander with a newspaper and takes that bystander’s cracking open the newspaper to be the signal to act.\n% Plausibly, then, the members of the flash mob might each intend that they, the members of the flash mob and this bystander, crack open their newspapers together.\n% Now suppose that, just by chance, the bystander figures out what is going on.\n% As someone who enjoys this kind of thing, she might crack open her newspaper with the intention that she and the members of the flash mob crack open their newspapers together.\n% So the feature under consideration as distinctive of joint action is present:\n% there is an action type such that the bystander and the members of the flash mob each intend that they, these people, perform such an action together.\n% But for all this it seems the bystander is not taking part in a joint action.\n% Apparently, then, %it is possible for two or more agents to each intend that they do one thing together and to act on these intentions without them thereby performing a joint action.\n% our being involved in a joint action can’t be a matter only of there being something such that we each intend that we, you and I, do it together.\n%  What are we missing?\n\n% \\emph{*Example not very compelling: replace it with two people blocking the aisle (each unilaterally intends that they block the aisle, correctly predicting that the other will not move while remaining agnostic about why).}\n\n\nIt’s just here that, in philosophy at least, things get a little wild.\nAttempts to provide the missing ingredient in characterising joint action include introducing novel kinds of intentions \\citep{Searle:1990em} or modes \\citep{gallotti:2013_social}, novel kinds of agents \\citep{helm_plural_2008}, and novel kinds of reasoning \\citep{Gold:2007zd}.\nOthers suggest embedding intentions in special kinds of commitment \\citep{gilbert:2014_book}, or creating special nested structures of intention and common knowledge \\citep{bratman:2014_book}.\nPerhaps some or all of these innovations are in some way useful.\nBut are they really needed just to understand how joint actions differ from event involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n\nThe dominant assumption is that they are.\nTo illustrate, consider Gilbert’s position.\nAccording to her, all joint action involves shared intention, and our having a shared intention that we $\\phi$ involves our being jointly committed to emulate a single body with an intention that it  $\\phi$.\nIn order to create the joint commitment necessary for us to have a shared intention, we must each openly express readiness to participate in this commitment.\nFurther, it must be common knowledge among us that we each express such readiness.\nHer account thus implies that, in order for us to share a smile or carry a two-handled picnic basket together, each of us must know that the other is ready to form a joint commitment to emulate a single body with an intention to carry the basket \\citep[][p.~334]{gilbert:2014_book}.\nFew would agree with Gilbert that exactly this nesting of mental states and commitments is necessary for joint action (this is no reflection on Gilbert—few philosophers would agree with anyone’s view on what is necessary for joint action).\nBut many do follow Gilbert in thinking that distinguishing the kind of joint action involved in the examples given at the start of this chapter requires either comparably complex nested structures or novel ingredients.\n\nBy contrast Bratman has recently observed, in effect, that introducing such complex structures or novel ingredients is not obviously needed just to distinguish joint action from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel \\citep[p.~105]{bratman:2014_book}.\nFor all anyone has yet shown, there may be a way of capturing what is distinctive of the kind of joint actions mentioned at the start of this chapter without invoking novel ingredients or structures.\nThis chapter explores the possibility that there is, with the twofold aim of constructing a minimalist theoretical framework for understanding at least simple forms joint action and illuminating the nature of the intentions and commitments involved in the most sophisticated forms of joint action.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{A Minimalist Approach: First Step}\n \n% §± minimalist_approach\nTaking a minimalist approach means finding a simplest possible starting point, adding ingredients only as needed, and adding only ingredients widely used outside of philosophical and narrowly theoretical debates.\n% ±§\nWhat determines whether an additional ingredient is needed?\nThe aim is to distinguish joint actions like those mentioned at the start of the chapter from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\n\n% The minimalist approach combines two things that are already familiar but have yet to be combined.\n% Its focus is on the simplest, rather than the most sophisticated, cases of joint action, and it follows Bratman (and one strand of Gilbert’s thinking, too) in aiming to avoid conceptual innovation.\n\nAs a promising starting point, consider a claim from Ludwig's semantic analysis:\n%\n\\begin{quote}\n% §± ludwig_joint_action p.366 #quote key.ludwig_collective_2007\n  ‘A \\emph{joint action} is an event with two or more agents’ %, as  contrasted with an \\emph{individual action} which is an event with a  single agent’\n% ±§\n \\citep[p.\\ ~366]{ludwig_collective_2007}.\n\\end{quote}\n%\nTo illustrate, suppose two hunters each hit a deer with an arrow.\nNeither shot was individually fatal but together they were deadly.\nIn this case the hunters are agents of the killing of the deer, so the event counts as  a joint action on Ludwig’s proposal.\n\nTo fully understand Ludwig’s proposal we need to understand what it is for an individual to be among the agents of an arbitrary event and not just an action.\nThis can be done in terms of a notion of grounding which I adapt from a discussion of action by \\citet{pietroski_actions_1998}.\n% §± pietroski_grounding\nPietroski identified a simple and elegant way of generalising from the idea that an individual can be the agent of an action to the idea that an individual can be the agent of a larger event.\n(His account does require a minor correction, but this is not relevant here.)\nHis approach can be generalised to allow for any number of agents.\n% §± grounding #df\nLet us stipulate that events $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ \\emph{ground} $E$, if: $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ and $E$ occur;\n$D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ are each (perhaps improper) parts of $E$; and\nevery event that is a proper part of $E$ but does not overlap $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ is caused by some or all of $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$.\n% ±§\n% §± agent_of_event #df\nThen let us say that for an individual to be \\emph{among the agents of an event} is for there to be actions $A_1$, ...\\ $A_n$ which  ground this event, where the individual is an agent of some (one or more) of these actions.\n% ±§\n% ±§\n% §± pietroski_grounding_illustration\nTo illustrate, consider the hunters again.\nLet \\textsc{the episode} be an event comprising only the hunter’s actions, the deer’s death and the events causally linking these.\nSince, for each hunter, there is a set of events including the hunter’s shooting which ground \\textsc{the episode}, we can conclude that \\textsc{the episode} is a joint action on Ludwig’s proposed definition.\n% ±§\n\nThis definition is too broad.\nTo see why, first recall our premise that one requirement on any account of joint action is this: \nit should distinguish joint actions like those mentioned at the start of this chapter from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\nNow consider two ways of elaborating the story about the hunters.\nIn one they are best friends who have set out together with the aim of killing this deer, and they are exhibiting many features associated with paradigm cases of joint action.\nIn the other elaboration, the hunters are bitter rivals completely unaware of each other’s presence.\nIn fact, were either to have suspected the other was present, she would have abandoned the deer in order to target her rival.\nIn both elaborations, Ludwig’s proposal entails that \\textsc{the episode} is a joint action.\nBut whereas the best friends elaboration resembles paradigm cases of joint action, the bitter rivals are merely acting in parallel.\nBy itself, Ludwig’s attractively simple proposal is insufficient.%\n\\footnote{%\nShould we have considered the idea that a joint action is an \\emph{action} (rather than an event) with two or more agents?\nThis question raises several issues beyond the scope of the present chapter.\nThe short answer is no, because primitive actions (whether bodily movements or tryings) are ‘all the actions there are’ \\citep[p.~59]{Davidson:1971fz}, and in many paradigm cases of joint action there are clearly no primitive actions with multiple agents.\nIn painting a house, walking together or lifting a two-handled basket we each move only our own bodies directly. \nThe notion of a joint action as an action with two or more agents is therefore too narrow relative to our aim of theorising about a range of cases taken to be paradigmatic joint actions.\n(This is not to say that no actions have two or more agents; see \\citealp{blomberg:2011_socially}.)\n}\n\nWhat is missing from this first attempt to capture joint action?\nMany joint actions are goal-directed in the sense that, among all their actual outcomes, there is an outcome to which they are directed.\nPerhaps we can make progress by integrating goal-directedness into our theoretical framework.\n\n\\section{Goal Directed Joint Action}\n\\label{sec:goal-directed-joint}\n\n\n% §± goal #df\nA \\emph{goal} of some actions is an outcome to which they are directed.\n% ±§\n% §± goal_state #df\nA \\emph{goal-state} is a state of an agent which specifies an outcome and which is, or could be, related to the agent’s actions in such a way that these actions are directed to the outcome represented.\n% ±§\nIntentions are perhaps the most familiar kind of goal-state.\n% §± goal_goal-state\nNote that, confusingly, the term ‘goal’ is sometimes used for what I am calling goal-states.\nWhatever terminology is used, it is essential to distinguish goals from goal-states.\nFrom the fact that an action is directed to a particular goal it does not follow that the agent of the action has a goal-state representing this goal \\citep{Bratman:1984jr}.\nIt doesn't even follow that the agent has any goal-states at all if, as some have argued, it is possible to understand what it is for at least some actions to be directed to goals without appeal to goal-states \\citep[e.g.][]{Bennett:1976rg,Taylor:1964tr}. \n% ±§\n\nAlmost all %not swinging

Challenge is to capture the distinction.\n\n\n% The existence of joint actions—things such as carrying a heavy picnic basket together or playing a piano duet—is sometimes taken to warrant the creation of complex structures, often involving conceptual or ontological novelties and invariably occasioning terminological innovation.\n% But we can understand much about joint action without any of this, or so I aim to show in this chapter.\n% %, which introduces a minimally novel conceptual framework.\n% %My aim is to demonstrate how much can be achieved with the \n\nThere are phenomena, call them \\emph{joint actions}, paradigm cases of which are held to involve two people \n\tpainting a house together \\citep{Bratman:1992mi}, \n\tlifting a heavy sofa together \\citep{Velleman:1997oo}, \n\tpreparing a hollandaise sauce together \\citep{Searle:1990em}, \n\tgoing to Chicago together \\citep{Kutz:2000si}, \n\tand walking together \\citep{gilbert_walking_1990}.\nIn developmental psychology paradigm cases of joint action include  two people \n\ttidying up the toys together \\citep{Behne:2005qh},\n\tcooperatively pulling handles in sequence to make a dog-puppet sing \\citep{Brownell:2006gu},\n\tbouncing a block on a large trampoline together \\citep{Tomasello:2007gl},\n\tand pretending to row a boat together.\nOther paradigm cases from research in cognitive psychology include two people\n\tlifting a two-handled basket  \\citep{Knoblich:2008hy},\n\tputting a stick through a ring \\citep{ramenzoni_joint_2011},\n\tand swinging their legs in phase \\citep[p. 284]{schmidt_richardons:_2008}.\nWhat feature or features distinguish joint actions such as these from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n\n\n% the question matters\nThis is a useful question to pursue because\njoint action raises {a tangle of scientific and philosophical questions}.\n%\nPsychologically and neuroscientifically we want to know which mechanisms make it possible \\citep{Sebanz:2006yq,vesper_minimal_2010,sacheli:2015_causative}.\nDevelopmentally we want to know when joint action emerges, what it presupposes and whether it might somehow facilitate socio-cognitive, pragmatic or symbolic development \\citep{Moll:2007gu,Hughes:2004zj,Brownell:2006gu}.\nPhenomenologically we want to characterise what (if anything) is special about experiences of action and agency when collective agency is involved \\citep{Pacherie:2010fk}.\nMetaphysically we want to know what kinds of entities and structures are implied by the existence of joint action \\citep{helm_plural_2008,Searle:1994lb}.\nAnd normatively we want to know what kinds of commitments (if any) are entailed by joint action and how these commitments arise \\citep{Roth:2004ki,gilbert:2014_book}.\n%, plus a formal account of how practical reasoning for joint action differs (if at all) from individual practical reasoning \\citep{Sugden:2000mw,Gold:2007zd}\n%\nIn investigating these questions it is useful to have a conceptual framework which enables us to distinguish systematically between joint and individual action.\nThis is why we should ask, What distinguishes joint actions from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n \n\nCould coordination be this distinguishing feature?\nCompare two sisters cycling to school together with two strangers who, some way behind the sisters, happen to be cycling the same route side-by-side.\nBoth pairs of cyclists need to coordinate their actions in order to avoid colliding, but only the former is a joint action.\nSo the bare fact that actions are coordinated, even very tightly coordinated in ways that require expertise, cannot be what distinguishes joint action from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\n\nAnother  initially tempting idea is that common effects distinguish joint actions.\nWhen members of a flash mob in Café Central respond to a pre-arranged cue by noisily opening their newspapers, they perform a joint action with a common effect.\nBut when someone not part of the mob just happens to noisily open her newspaper in response to the same cue, her action is not part of any joint action.\nYet her action together with those of the members of a flash mob have a common effect.\nSo what distinguishes joint actions from events involving multiple agents who merely act in parallel can’t be just that joint actions have common effects.\n \n \nAt this point it is natural to appeal to intention.\nIf we are performing actions of some type $\\phi$,\nthen perhaps for our doing this to be a joint action is just for us to be doing this\nbecause we each intend that we, you and I, $\\phi$ together.\n% Intentional joint action occurs when there is an act-type, φ, such that each of several agents intends that they, these agents, φ.\n(Does the appeal to togetherness make this circular? Not as long as we understand ‘together’ only in the sense in which the three legs of a tripod can support a flask {together}.\nCan one person have intentions which concern not only her own actions but also others’?\nYes, see \\citet{Bratman:1993je}.)\nAppealing to intention seems to take us further than the first two ideas (coordination and common effects).\nConsider the cycling sisters again.\nWe could suppose that each sister intends that they, the two sisters cycle to school together; but nothing like this is plausibly true of the strangers who just happen to be cycling side-by-side.\n\nHave we already understood what distinguishes joint action?\nImagine two sisters who, getting off an aeroplane, tacitly agree to exact revenge on the unruly mob of drunken hens behind them by standing so as to block the aisle together.\nThis is a joint action.\nMeanwhile on another plane, two strangers happen to be so configured that they are collectively blocking the aisle.\nThe first passenger correctly anticipates that the other passenger, who is a complete stranger, will not be moving from her current position for some time.\nThis creates an opportunity for the first passenger: she intends that they, she and the stranger, block the aisle.\nAnd, as it happens, the second passenger’s thoughts mirror the first’s.\nSo the feature under consideration as distinctive of joint action is present: each passenger is acting on her intention that they, the two passengers, block the aisle.\nBut the contrast between this case and the sisters exacting revenge suggests that these passengers are not taking part in a joint action—at least, their’s is not the kind of joint action associated with the paradigm cases mentioned at the start of this chapter.\nApparently, then, %it is possible for two or more agents to each intend that they do one thing together and to act on these intentions without them thereby performing a joint action.\nour being involved in a joint action can’t be a matter only of there being something such that we each intend that we, you and I, do it together.\n What are we missing?\n\n% Consider the flash mob and the bystander again.\n% Suppose the flash mob picks out an arbitrary bystander with a newspaper and takes that bystander’s cracking open the newspaper to be the signal to act.\n% Plausibly, then, the members of the flash mob might each intend that they, the members of the flash mob and this bystander, crack open their newspapers together.\n% Now suppose that, just by chance, the bystander figures out what is going on.\n% As someone who enjoys this kind of thing, she might crack open her newspaper with the intention that she and the members of the flash mob crack open their newspapers together.\n% So the feature under consideration as distinctive of joint action is present:\n% there is an action type such that the bystander and the members of the flash mob each intend that they, these people, perform such an action together.\n% But for all this it seems the bystander is not taking part in a joint action.\n% Apparently, then, %it is possible for two or more agents to each intend that they do one thing together and to act on these intentions without them thereby performing a joint action.\n% our being involved in a joint action can’t be a matter only of there being something such that we each intend that we, you and I, do it together.\n%  What are we missing?\n\n% \\emph{*Example not very compelling: replace it with two people blocking the aisle (each unilaterally intends that they block the aisle, correctly predicting that the other will not move while remaining agnostic about why).}\n\n\nIt’s just here that, in philosophy at least, things get a little wild.\nAttempts to provide the missing ingredient in characterising joint action include introducing novel kinds of intentions \\citep{Searle:1990em} or modes \\citep{gallotti:2013_social}, novel kinds of agents \\citep{helm_plural_2008}, and novel kinds of reasoning \\citep{Gold:2007zd}.\nOthers suggest embedding intentions in special kinds of commitment \\citep{gilbert:2014_book}, or creating special nested structures of intention and common knowledge \\citep{bratman:2014_book}.\nPerhaps some or all of these innovations are in some way useful.\nBut are they really needed just to understand how joint actions differ from event involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel?\n\nThe dominant assumption is that they are.\nTo illustrate, consider Gilbert’s position.\nAccording to her, all joint action involves shared intention, and our having a shared intention that we $\\phi$ involves our being jointly committed to emulate a single body with an intention that it  $\\phi$.\nIn order to create the joint commitment necessary for us to have a shared intention, we must each openly express readiness to participate in this commitment.\nFurther, it must be common knowledge among us that we each express such readiness.\nHer account thus implies that, in order for us to share a smile or carry a two-handled picnic basket together, each of us must know that the other is ready to form a joint commitment to emulate a single body with an intention to carry the basket \\citep[][p.~334]{gilbert:2014_book}.\nFew would agree with Gilbert that exactly this nesting of mental states and commitments is necessary for joint action (this is no reflection on Gilbert—few philosophers would agree with anyone’s view on what is necessary for joint action).\nBut many do follow Gilbert in thinking that distinguishing the kind of joint action involved in the examples given at the start of this chapter requires either comparably complex nested structures or novel ingredients.\n\nBy contrast Bratman has recently observed, in effect, that introducing such complex structures or novel ingredients is not obviously needed just to distinguish joint action from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel \\citep[p.~105]{bratman:2014_book}.\nFor all anyone has yet shown, there may be a way of capturing what is distinctive of the kind of joint actions mentioned at the start of this chapter without invoking novel ingredients or structures.\nThis chapter explores the possibility that there is, with the twofold aim of constructing a minimalist theoretical framework for understanding at least simple forms joint action and illuminating the nature of the intentions and commitments involved in the most sophisticated forms of joint action.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{A Minimalist Approach: First Step}\n \n% §± minimalist_approach\nTaking a minimalist approach means finding a simplest possible starting point, adding ingredients only as needed, and adding only ingredients widely used outside of philosophical and narrowly theoretical debates.\n% ±§\nWhat determines whether an additional ingredient is needed?\nThe aim is to distinguish joint actions like those mentioned at the start of the chapter from events involving multiple agents who are merely acting in parallel.\n\n% The minimalist approach combines two things that are already familiar but have yet to be combined.\n% Its focus is on the simplest, rather than the most sophisticated, cases of joint action, and it follows Bratman (and one strand of Gilbert’s thinking, too) in aiming to avoid conceptual innovation.\n\nAs a promising starting point, consider a claim from Ludwig's semantic analysis:\n%\n\\begin{quote}\n% §± ludwig_joint_action p.366 #quote key.ludwig_collective_2007\n  ‘A \\emph{joint action} is an event with two or more agents’ %, as  contrasted with an \\emph{individual action} which is an event with a  single agent’\n% ±§\n \\citep[p.\\ ~366]{ludwig_collective_2007}.\n\\end{quote}\n%\nTo illustrate, suppose two hunters each hit a deer with an arrow.\nNeither shot was individually fatal but together they were deadly.\nIn this case the hunters are agents of the killing of the deer, so the event counts as  a joint action on Ludwig’s proposal.\n\nTo fully understand Ludwig’s proposal we need to understand what it is for an individual to be among the agents of an arbitrary event and not just an action.\nThis can be done in terms of a notion of grounding which I adapt from a discussion of action by \\citet{pietroski_actions_1998}.\n% §± pietroski_grounding\nPietroski identified a simple and elegant way of generalising from the idea that an individual can be the agent of an action to the idea that an individual can be the agent of a larger event.\n(His account does require a minor correction, but this is not relevant here.)\nHis approach can be generalised to allow for any number of agents.\n% §± grounding #df\nLet us stipulate that events $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ \\emph{ground} $E$, if: $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ and $E$ occur;\n$D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ are each (perhaps improper) parts of $E$; and\nevery event that is a proper part of $E$ but does not overlap $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$ is caused by some or all of $D_1$, ...\\ $D_n$.\n% ±§\n% §± agent_of_event #df\nThen let us say that for an individual to be \\emph{among the agents of an event} is for there to be actions $A_1$, ...\\ $A_n$ which  ground this event, where the individual is an agent of some (one or more) of these actions.\n% ±§\n% ±§\n% §± pietroski_grounding_illustration\nTo illustrate, consider the hunters again.\nLet \\textsc{the episode} be an event comprising only the hunter’s actions, the deer’s death and the events causally linking these.\nSince, for each hunter, there is a set of events including the hunter’s shooting which ground \\textsc{the episode}, we can conclude that \\textsc{the episode} is a joint action on Ludwig’s proposed definition.\n% ±§\n\nThis definition is too broad.\nTo see why, first recall our premise that one requirement on any account of joint action is this: \nit should distinguish joint actions like those mentioned at the start of this chapter from
